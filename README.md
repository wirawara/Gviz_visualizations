Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a method to study DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale at single-nucleotide resolution. RRBS is a variation of whole genome bisulfite conversion sequencing that uses restriction enzyme digestion and DNA size selection to focus the analysis on a subset of the genome where the majority of the DNA methylation occurs. Focusing on this portion of the genome generates a genome-wide DNA methylation data set at a lower DNA sequencing cost than WGBS.
